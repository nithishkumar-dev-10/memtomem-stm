## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-10

### Critical

- **Fix server lifespan not connected** — `app_lifespan` was assigned to a non-existent `_lifespan_handler` attribute on FastMCP, making the entire server non-functional when run via CLI. Now passed via the `lifespan=` constructor kwarg.
- **Propagate upstream `isError` flag** — upstream tool errors were silently converted to success responses. Now raises `ToolError` so `isError=true` is preserved in the proxied response.

### Fixes

- Fix `_surfaced_ids` set pruning modifying a set during iteration (potential `RuntimeError` on CPython 3.12+); now uses snapshot via `itertools.islice`
- Fix `_parse_results` regex splitting on `---` inside content (YAML frontmatter, markdown horizontal rules); now requires score bracket `[N.N]` after separator
- Fix `_parse_scratch_list` truncating keys containing `: ` (e.g., `db: config`); now uses `rfind` heuristic anchored on trailing `...` marker
- Record metrics for non-text-only responses (images, embedded resources) instead of returning silently
- Pass original arguments (with `_context_query`) to surfacing on cache hit so the agent's query hint is preserved
- Snapshot config once per request in `_call_tool_inner` to prevent intra-request inconsistency from hot-reload
- Guard against double `start()` leaking connections by closing previous stack first
- Normalize `\r\n` and `\r` to `\n` in content cleaning before processing
- NFKC-normalize text before injection pattern matching to defeat Unicode confusable bypasses (Cyrillic, fullwidth)
- Add CJK sentence-end punctuation (`。！？`) to `_find_break` for better truncation points in East Asian text
- Widen UUID-based IDs from 12 hex (48 bits) to 16 hex (64 bits) to reduce collision probability
- Add `ProxyCache.stats()` thread-safety lock
- Wrap `_fastmcp_compat` private API access (`_tool_manager._tools`) in try/except for resilience against MCP SDK updates
- Move `feedback_tracker` creation inside `mcp_adapter` success guard so feedback endpoints are not activated when surfacing init fails

### Docs

- Add `stm_proxy_health` tool to cli.md tool table (was missing; tool count 6 → 7)
- Correct README tool count (6 → 7)
- Remove `selective` from auto-selection flowchart in compression.md (`auto_select_strategy` never returns SELECTIVE)
- Update Note to list `selective` alongside `progressive` and `llm_summary` as opt-in only

### Testing

- 800 automated tests (33 new in `test_qa_round3.py`)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-10

### CLI
- `mms -h` short flag now works (previously only `--help`)
- `mms status` and `mms list` now show compression strategy and max_chars per server
- Add `auto` to `--compression` choices and set it as the default (aligned with `ProxyConfig.default_compression`)
- Validate `--prefix` format (must start with a letter, no `__`) and warn on duplicate prefixes
- Require `--command` for stdio transport, `--url` for sse/streamable_http transport
- Support quoted paths with spaces in `--args` (via `shlex.split`)

### Fixes
- Resolve all mypy type errors across proxy and surfacing modules (assert guards for optional AsyncClient)
- Fix `cache.clear(tool=X)` without `server` silently wiping entire cache instead of filtering by tool
- Fix `proxy.enabled` field being ignored at runtime — server now skips upstream connections when disabled
- Fix non-deterministic ordering in feedback rating error message

### Docs
- Add uv install options to README and Langfuse extra install sections
- Add CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, and SECURITY files
- Sync LICENSE copyright and pyproject authors with parent memtomem repo
- Align `stm_proxy_stats` example output in operations.md with actual code
- Document `[proxied]` tool description prefix and `{prefix}__{name}` naming convention
- Document that progressive delivery skips memory surfacing
- Clarify hot-reload scope (per-server settings only; adding/removing servers requires restart)
- Fix stale `min_result_retention` docstring (0.5 → 0.65)

### Meta
- Correct pyproject Homepage/Repository URLs

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-10

Initial open-source release.

### Proxy pipeline
- 4-stage pipeline: CLEAN → COMPRESS → SURFACE → INDEX
- MCP server entrypoint (`memtomem-stm`) and proxy CLI (`memtomem-stm-proxy` / `mms`)
- Transparent proxying for upstream MCP servers over stdio, SSE, and HTTP
- Per-upstream namespacing via `--prefix` (e.g. `fs__read_file`)

### Compression
- 10 strategies with auto-selection by content type
- Query-aware budget allocation (more tokens for query-relevant content)
- Zero-loss progressive delivery (full content on request via cache)
- Model-aware defaults

### Memory surfacing
- Proactive surfacing from a memtomem LTM server via MCP
- Relevance threshold gating (configurable)
- Rate limit + query cooldown
- Session and cross-session dedup
- Write-tool skip (no surfacing on mutations)
- Circuit breaker with retry + exponential backoff

### Caching
- Response cache with TTL and eviction
- Surfacing re-applied on cache hit (injected memories stay fresh)
- Auto-indexing of responses into LTM (when configured)

### Safety
- Sensitive content auto-detection (skip caching/indexing of responses with detected secrets)
- Circuit breaker per upstream
- Configurable write-tool skip list

### Observability
- Langfuse tracing (optional extra: `pip install "memtomem-stm[langfuse]"`)
- RPS, latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99), error classification, per-tool metrics
- `stm_proxy_stats` MCP tool for in-agent inspection

### Horizontal scaling
- `PendingStore` protocol with InMemory (default) and SQLite shared backends

### Testing
- 767 automated tests
- CI: GitHub Actions (lint, typecheck, test)

### Related projects
- [**memtomem**](https://github.com/memtomem/memtomem) — Long-term memory infrastructure. memtomem-stm surfaces memories from a running memtomem MCP server; the two communicate entirely through the MCP protocol with no shared Python dependency.
