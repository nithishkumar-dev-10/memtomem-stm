# Contributing to memtomem-stm

Thank you for your interest in contributing to memtomem-stm!

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/memtomem/memtomem-stm.git
cd memtomem-stm

# Install (requires Python 3.12+ and uv)
uv sync

# Run tests
uv run pytest -m "not ollama"          # skip Ollama-dependent tests
uv run pytest                          # full suite (requires running Ollama)

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check src
uv run ruff format src

# Type check
uv run mypy src
```

## Project Structure

- `src/memtomem_stm/` — Core: MCP server, proxy pipeline, compression, surfacing, caching, observability
  - `proxy/` — 4-stage pipeline (CLEAN → COMPRESS → SURFACE → INDEX), privacy scanning
  - `surfacing/` — Memory surfacing engine and relevance gating
  - `observability/` — Langfuse tracing and metrics
  - `cli/` — `mms` / `memtomem-stm-proxy` CLI
  - `utils/` — Circuit breaker and shared helpers
- `tests/` — pytest suite
  - `tests/bench/` — `bench_qa` scenario harness (see "Adding a bench_qa scenario" below)
- `docs/` — User-facing guides (surfacing, compression, caching, configuration, cli)

The LTM core lives in a separate repository: [memtomem/memtomem](https://github.com/memtomem/memtomem). Communication between STM and LTM happens entirely through the MCP protocol — there is no Python-level dependency.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per PR
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Ensure `uv run ruff check src` and `uv run ruff format --check src` pass
5. Ensure `uv run pytest -m "not ollama"` passes
6. `uv run mypy src` is advisory but aim to not introduce new errors
7. Write a clear commit message describing the "why"
8. Sign the CLA on your first pull request (see below)

## Adding a bench_qa scenario

`bench_qa` is an end-to-end pytest sub-suite that drives the proxy
pipeline through fixture scenarios and asserts compression +
answerability gates. The full harness reference lives in the private
`memtomem/memtomem-docs` repo (`memtomem-stm/testing/bench_qa.md`); the
short version follows. When adding a new scenario:

1. Create `tests/bench/fixtures/s{NN}.json` following
   `tests/bench/bench_qa/schema.py` (`FIXTURE_SCHEMA_VERSION = 1`).
   Required: `schema_version`, `scenario_id`, `payload`,
   `expected_compressor`.
2. Register the scenario:
   - Normal path → append to `NORMAL_PATH_SCENARIOS` in
     `tests/bench/test_bench_qa_scenarios.py`.
   - Fallback ladder (`force_tier` set) → add a test function in
     `tests/bench/test_bench_qa_fallback.py` mirroring the s01/s06/s08
     pattern (stub higher tiers to raise).
3. If the scenario is eligible for the advisory LLM judge, append its
   ID to `LLM_JUDGE_SCENARIOS` in
   `tests/bench/test_bench_qa_llm_judge.py`. `force_tier` scenarios
   are currently excluded — the judge was calibrated on happy paths.
4. Update `tests/bench/test_bench_qa_meta.py` so the harness self-test
   proves `bench_qa` actually catches the regression the new scenario
   is meant to guard against. A green scenario that does not fail on
   a seeded regression is a silent no-op.
5. Run both `uv run pytest -m bench_qa` and `-m bench_qa_meta`; they
   must stay green. If you changed anything the LLM judge touches,
   also run `OPENAI_API_KEY=… uv run pytest -m bench_qa_llm_judge`
   and sanity-check the correlation log.
