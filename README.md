Short-term memory proxy gateway with **proactive memory surfacing** for AI agents.

Sits between your AI agent and upstream MCP servers. Compresses responses to save tokens, caches results, and automatically surfaces relevant memories from a memtomem LTM server.

**Built for:**
- Agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.) running multiple MCP servers and burning tokens on noisy upstream responses
- Long-running coding sessions where the agent should *recall* prior decisions instead of re-searching
- Teams running custom MCP servers that need a proxy layer for compression, caching, and observability — no upstream code changes required

## Installation

```bash
pip install memtomem-stm
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv tool install memtomem-stm     # install mms / memtomem-stm as global CLI tools
uvx memtomem-stm --help          # or run without installing
uv pip install memtomem-stm      # or install into the active environment
```

memtomem-stm is **independent**: it has no Python-level dependency on memtomem core. To enable proactive memory surfacing, point STM at a running memtomem MCP server (or any compatible MCP server) — communication happens entirely through the MCP protocol.

## Quick Start

`mms` is the short alias for `memtomem-stm-proxy` — both commands are identical, use whichever you prefer.

### 1. Add an upstream MCP server

```bash
mms add filesystem \
  --command npx \
  --args "-y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /home/user/projects" \
  --prefix fs
```

`--prefix` is required: it's the namespace under which the upstream server's tools will appear (e.g. `fs__read_file`). Repeat for each MCP server you want to proxy.

```bash
mms list      # show what you've added
mms status    # show full config + connectivity
```

### 2. Connect your AI client to STM

Point your MCP client at the `memtomem-stm` server instead of the upstream servers directly. For Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add memtomem-stm -s user -- memtomem-stm
```

Or add it to a JSON MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memtomem-stm": {
      "command": "memtomem-stm"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Use the proxied tools

Your agent now sees proxied tools (`fs__read_file`, `gh__search_repositories`, etc.). Every call goes through the 4-stage pipeline automatically — responses are cleaned, compressed, cached, and (when an LTM server is configured) enriched with relevant memories.

To check what's happening, ask the agent to call `stm_proxy_stats`.

## Tutorial notebooks

Want to see STM's behavior without wiring it into Claude Code first? The [`notebooks/`](notebooks/) directory contains six runnable Jupyter notebooks: a CLI-MCP prelude (00), quickstart setup (01), selective compression (02), memory surfacing (03), a LangChain agent integration (04), and observability/Langfuse tracing (05). Clone the repo, run `uv sync`, and `uv run jupyter lab notebooks/` — no external services required for notebooks 00–03 and 05.

## Development

```bash
uv sync                                                    # install dev deps
uv run pytest -m "not ollama"                              # tests (CI filter)
uv run ruff check src && uv run ruff format --check src    # lint (required)
uv run mypy src                                            # typecheck (advisory)
```

CI runs the same commands on every PR via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Lint (`ruff check` + `ruff format --check`) and tests must pass; mypy is advisory.
