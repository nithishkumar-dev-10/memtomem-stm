            # 00 — Hybrid CLI + MCP: how the pieces fit

            memtomem-stm has two faces. You talk to **one** at configuration
            time, and **another** at runtime — and the two are the same
            process wearing different hats.

            - **`mms` CLI** — the operator interface. You run it to
              register upstream MCP servers, list them, check status,
              remove them. It writes to a JSON config file. It's what
              you use *before* you hand STM over to an agent.
            - **`memtomem-stm` MCP server** — the agent interface.
              It reads that same JSON config, spawns the upstreams as
              subprocesses, and exposes them as proxied tools over the
              MCP stdio transport. It's what the agent talks to.

            This notebook is a prelude to the rest of the series: it
            walks both interfaces end-to-end against a trivial echo
            fixture so you can see the relationship explicitly. Every
            other notebook (01 through 05) assumes you already have this
            mental model.

            **You will learn:**

            - How `mms add` / `mms list` shape STM's config file
            - How the MCP server surfaces what the CLI registered
            - Where each side's responsibility ends

            **Prereqs:** `uv sync` (dev group, includes Jupyter). No
            external services. No API keys for the 3 core cells — an
            optional LangChain cell at the bottom gates itself on
            `_HAS_KEY`.

            - **`echo__say`** — the echo fixture's own tool,
              namespaced with the `--prefix echo` you passed to
              `mms add`. STM discovered this dynamically when it
              connected to the upstream.
            - **`stm_proxy_*` / `stm_surfacing_*`** — STM's own
              built-in tools (proxy stats, health, selective chunk
              retrieval, surfacing feedback, etc.) — present on every
              instance regardless of what's registered.

            The CLI wrote the upstream entry. The MCP server read it,
            spawned the subprocess, merged the upstream's tools into
            its own catalog, and served the whole catalog to you. That
            hand-off is the entire hybrid model.

            Everything above used the raw MCP client. In practice you
            put a real agent framework in front of STM so the tool
            calls happen as part of an autonomous loop. The cell below

            notebook 04 has the full walkthrough including tool
            streaming and result inspection.

            This cell **does not run** unless you have an API key. It
            checks for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` and
            short-circuits if neither is set, so the notebook stays

            ## Recap

            You just watched the same tool flow through both interfaces:

            1. **CLI time** — `mms add echo` wrote an entry in an
               isolated `stm_proxy.json`. `mms list` read it back.
            2. **MCP time** — `stm_session()` spawned `memtomem-stm`,
               which loaded that same JSON, launched the echo fixture
               as a subprocess, and served `echo__say` to you as a
               proxied tool. `stm_proxy_stats` recorded the call.
            3. **Agent time (optional)** — a LangChain
               `create_agent` wrapped the same catalog and drove it
               autonomously.

            Three interfaces, one config file, one running STM process.
            Every notebook from here on skips straight to the MCP
            client view; refer back to this one whenever the CLI
            ↔ MCP hand-off feels fuzzy.

            ## Where to next

            - **Notebook 01** — deeper dive into the MCP client side
              with `stm_proxy_stats` interpretation.
            - **Notebook 02** — selective compression: turning an
              18 KB structured response into a 1.5 KB TOC.
            - **Notebook 03** — proactive memory surfacing with a
              fake LTM.
            - **Notebook 04** — full LangChain / LangGraph agent
              integration.

            You just routed a tool call through STM:

            1. `mms add` wrote an entry in an isolated `stm_proxy.json`
            2. STM loaded that config on startup and spawned `echo_mcp.py`
               as a subprocess
            3. Your `session.call_tool("echo__say", ...)` call flowed
               `notebook → STM → echo → STM → notebook`
            4. STM's `TokenTracker` recorded the call in its stats

            The echo server returns tiny responses, so no compression fires
            yet. **Notebook 02** swaps in a large structured document and
            shows STM's selective compression producing a table of contents.

            In notebook 01 you saw STM proxy a tiny response. Real upstream
            MCP servers return much bigger payloads — full files, long API
            responses, large directory listings — and those burn through
            the agent's context window fast.

            STM has **10 compression strategies**. This notebook focuses
            on the most useful one for structured data: **selective
            compression**, which returns a *table of contents* and lets
            the agent request only the sections it needs via
            `stm_proxy_select_chunks`.

            # 03 — Memory surfacing with a fake LTM

            STM's headline feature is **proactive memory surfacing**:
            when an upstream tool returns, STM queries a long-term
            memory (LTM) server in the background and injects the most
            relevant chunks at the top of the response. The agent sees
            a single enriched response; no extra tool call needed.

            This notebook shows surfacing end-to-end **without requiring
            a real `memtomem-server`** — we point STM at
            `notebooks/_fixtures/fake_ltm.py`, a notebook-local stub
            that returns canned memories with per-call UUIDs so repeated
            runs stay deterministic and aren't silently suppressed by
            STM's cross-session dedup.

            - How STM's surfacing engine talks to an LTM via MCP
            - What an injected `<surfaced-memories>` block looks like

              can share a SQLite-backed pending store across multiple

            # 04 — LangChain agent integration *(optional, needs API key)*

            Notebooks 01–03 talked to STM using the raw MCP client so
            you could see every wire-level call. That's great for
            understanding how STM behaves, but it's not how you would
            *use* STM day-to-day. In practice you put a real agent
            framework in front of it.

            This notebook shows the simplest real-world integration:
            **LangChain `create_agent` + `langchain-mcp-adapters`**.
            `create_agent` is LangChain v1's canonical agent factory
            and returns a LangGraph graph under the hood, so using it
            also exercises LangGraph.

            **You will learn:**

            - How `langchain-mcp-adapters.load_mcp_tools` converts
              STM's proxied tools into LangChain `BaseTool` instances
            - How to build a ReAct-style agent with `create_agent` and
              run it end-to-end
            - How to verify STM saw every tool call by reading its
              stats after the agent finishes

            **Prereqs:**

            - `uv sync --extra langchain` — installs
              `langchain`, `langchain-mcp-adapters`, and
              `langchain-anthropic`
            - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your
              environment (the notebook auto-detects and skips if
              neither is present)

            **CI behavior:** This notebook is **excluded from CI** — no
            API keys in CI. Run it manually when you want to see the
            full agent loop.

            ## Recap

            You just ran a LangChain ReAct agent whose entire tool
            surface came from STM. Every call the agent made — reading
            the document, selecting chunks, checking stats — flowed
            through STM's pipeline: cleaned, compressed, cached,
            counted. The agent code didn't know STM exists.

            **What to try next:**

            - Replace the `docfix` fixture with a real upstream like
              `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` or
              `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`
            - Add a second `mms add` call for a second upstream and
              watch `load_mcp_tools` discover both
            - Swap `create_agent` for a custom `StateGraph` from
              LangGraph if you need more control over the loop
            - Enable surfacing (see notebook 03) and watch memories
              appear in the agent's observations automatically

            # 05 — Observability and Langfuse Tracing

            memtomem-stm provides three layers of observability:

            1. **MCP tools** — `stm_proxy_stats`, `stm_proxy_health`,
               `stm_surfacing_stats` give you an agent-accessible summary
               of what the proxy is doing.
            2. **SQLite metrics** — `proxy_metrics.db` and
               `stm_feedback.db` persist per-call metrics for offline
               analysis.
            3. **Langfuse tracing** — optional nested spans that let you
               visualize the full proxy pipeline in a shared team UI.

            This notebook demonstrates all three layers. Core cells run
            without any API keys; the live Langfuse cells gate themselves
            on `_HAS_LANGFUSE_KEY`.

            **Prereqs:** `uv sync` (dev group). Optional:
            `pip install "memtomem-stm[langfuse]"` plus Langfuse
            credentials for live tracing.

            The MCP tools give you a snapshot; SQLite gives you history.
            Langfuse adds **live, nested span visualization** across your
            entire proxy pipeline:

            | Span name | When | Metadata |
            |---|---|---|
            | `proxy_call` | Every proxy invocation | `server`, `tool`, `trace_id` |
            | `proxy_call_clean` | Content cleaning | `server`, `tool` |
            | `proxy_call_compress` | Compression | `server`, `tool`, `strategy` |
            | `proxy_call_surface` | Memory injection | `server`, `tool` |
            | `proxy_call_index` | Auto-indexing | `server`, `tool` |
            | `stm_surfacing_feedback` | Feedback tool | `surfacing_id`, `rating` |
            | `stm_surfacing_stats` | Stats query | `tool` |

            Every span is a no-op `nullcontext` when Langfuse is disabled
            — zero overhead.

            export MEMTOMEM_STM_LANGFUSE__ENABLED=true
            export MEMTOMEM_STM_LANGFUSE__PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...

            For high-throughput deployments, trace only a fraction of calls:

            ## 8. Trace context propagation

            When STM forwards calls to upstream servers, it includes a
            `_trace_id` field in the tool arguments. Upstream servers can
            extract this to correlate their own spans with the originating
            STM trace. The same mechanism works for LTM searches via the
            `McpClientSearchAdapter`.

            This makes end-to-end distributed tracing possible across the
            full `agent → STM proxy → upstream server` pipeline.

            ## 9. Log level configuration

            STM uses Python's `logging` module. Control verbosity via
            environment variable:

            ```bash
            export MEMTOMEM_STM_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING   # default
            export MEMTOMEM_STM_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG     # full pipeline tracing

            | Level | What it shows |
            |-------|---------------|
            | `DEBUG` | Pipeline tracing, strategy selection, cache decisions |
            | `INFO` | Surfacing injections, config reloads, extraction completions |
            | `WARNING` | Failure guards (F1/S1), fallback activations, skips |
            | `ERROR` | Unrecoverable failures (rare — most errors fall back) |

            The level is read once at startup — restart the server to
            apply changes. See
            [`docs/operations.md → Logging`](../docs/operations.md#logging)
            for format details.
