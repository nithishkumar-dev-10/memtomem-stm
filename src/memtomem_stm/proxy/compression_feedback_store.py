"""SQLite persistence for ``stm_compression_feedback`` reports.

This store captures agent-reported information loss from compressed proxy
responses. It is a **learning signal**, not a safety net — writes here do
not repair the current turn; they feed future auto-tuning and manual
audits via ``stm_compression_stats``.

The store shares its SQLite file with surfacing feedback
(``~/.memtomem/stm_feedback.db`` by default). SQLite WAL journaling makes
two connections to the same file safe for concurrent read/write, and the
table namespaces are disjoint so the two subsystems don't conflict.
