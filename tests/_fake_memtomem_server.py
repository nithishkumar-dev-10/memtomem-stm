"""Tiny stdio MCP server used by integration tests.

Stands in for `memtomem-server` so that STM's McpClientSearchAdapter can be
exercised end-to-end without depending on a real memtomem installation. It
exposes the two tools the adapter actually calls — ``mem_search`` and the
``mem_do`` meta-tool routing the ``scratch_get`` and ``increment_access``
actions — both returning canned text in the format the adapter knows how
to parse.

**Content must vary per call.** STM's cross-session dedup keys on
``sha256(content)[:16]`` (see
``src/memtomem_stm/surfacing/mcp_client.py:34``), so a fixture returning
identical content across calls gets silently suppressed after the first
run if the test exercises the ``FeedbackTracker`` path. The current
integration tests pass ``feedback_enabled=False`` and dodge this, but we
embed per-call UUIDs anyway so the fixture stays safe to drop into a
future test that *does* hit the dedup path. Assertions here are all
substring checks (``"JWT authentication"``, ``"current_task"``) so the
UUID suffixes are invisible to callers.

Run with: `python <path-to-this-file>`
